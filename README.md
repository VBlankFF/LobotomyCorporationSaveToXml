# Save to Xml mod for Lobotomy Corporation
This mod converts the game save to Xml files when you launch the game. It also loads the save data from the Xml instead of the normal .dat files. This allows you to edit the save.

See https://www.nexusmods.com/lobotomycorporation/mods/846 for the download link.
